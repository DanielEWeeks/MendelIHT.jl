    "This note is a more detailed version of our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giaa044). For a review on generalized linear models, I recommend chapter 15.3 of [Applied regression analysis and generalized linear models](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Regression-Analysis-Generalized-Linear/dp/1452205663/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Applied+Regression+Analysis+and+Generalized+Linear+Models&qid=1609298891&s=books&sr=1-2) by John Fox, or chapter 3-5 of [An introduction to generalized linear models](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Generalized-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1138741515/ref=sr_1_2?crid=18BN4MONNYYJH&dchild=1&keywords=an+introduction+to+generalized+linear+models&qid=1609298924&s=books&sprefix=an+introduction+to+ge%2Cstripbooks%2C222&sr=1-2) by Dobson and Barnett. \n",

    "In `MendelIHT.jl`, phenotypes $(\\bf y)$ are modeled as a [generalized linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model):\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\mu_i = E(y_i) = g({\\bf x}_i^t {\\bf \\beta})\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "where $\\bf x$ is sample $i$'s $p$-dimensional vector of *covariates* (genotypes + other fixed effects), $\\bf \\beta$ is a $p$-dimensional regression coefficients, $g$ is a non-linear *inverse-link* function, $y_i$ is sample $i$'s phenotype value, and $\\mu_i$ is the *average predicted value* of $y_i$ given $\\bf x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regression coefficients $\\bf \\beta$ is not observed and is estimated via **maximum likelihood**. The full design matrix $\\bf X$ (obtained by stacking each ${\\bf x}_i^t$ row-by-row) and phenotypes $\\bf y$ are observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "GLMs offer a natural way to model common non-continuous phenotypes. For instance, logistic regression for binary phenotypes and Poisson regression for integer valued phenotypes are special cases. Of course, when $g(\\alpha) = \\alpha,$ we get the standard linear model used for Gaussian phenotypes. "
