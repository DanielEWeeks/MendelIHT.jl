    "## Core Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "For advanced users, one can also run IHT regression or cross-validation directly. For cross validation, we generally recommend using `cv_iht`. This function cycles through the testing sets sequentially and fits different sparsity models in parallel. For larger problems (e.g. UK Biobank sized), one can instead choose to run `cv_iht_distribute_fold`. This function fits different sparsity models sequentially but initializes all training/testing model in parallel, which consumes more memory (see below). The later strategy allows one to distribute different sparsity parameters to different computers, achieving greater parallel power. \n",

    "    **Do not** delete intermediate files with random file names created by `cv_iht` and `cv_iht_distribute_fold` (windows users will be instructed to manually do so via print statements). These are memory-mapped files necessary for cross validation. For `cv_iht`, **you must have `x` GB of free space and RAM on your hard disk** where `x` is your `.bed` file size. For `cv_iht_distribute_fold`, you must have enough RAM and disk space to fit all `q` training datasets simultaneously, each of which typically requires `(q - 1)/q * x` GB. "
